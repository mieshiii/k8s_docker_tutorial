Workloads
 - is an application that runs within K8s
 - Pod - the atomic Workload, represents a set of running containers
 - ReplicaSet
    - primary method of pod replicas and their lifecycle to provide self-healing capabilities
    - always ensures the desired number of pods are running
    - while can be used, recommended is to use Deployments
 - Deployment
    - Deployments self-heal, scale, update, or rollback
    - deployment manages a single pod template
    - typically you create one deployment per microservice
    - ReplicaSet provides self-healing and scalability, Deployments for the updates and rollbacks
    - Deployment components(?)
      - replicas: number of pod instances
      - revisionHistoryLimit: number of prev iterations to keep
      - strategy: rolling update or recreate
      - 
 - StatefulSet 
    - for pods that must persist or maintain states
    - maintains a sticky idenity for each of their pods
    - each persistent identifier (name-x)
    - if a pod dies, it is replaced with another one using identifier
    - creates pods from 0-X, and deletes them from X-0
    - typical uses: stable network identifiers, stable databases using persistent storage

 - DaemonSet - provide node-local facilities, such as a storage driver or network plugin
    - ensures all Nodes (or subsets run an instance of a Pod)
    - scheduled by scheduller controller and run by daemon controller
    - as nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them
    - typical uses: cluster storage, logs collection, node monitoring
    
 - Tasks that run to completion: 
    - Job
      - workload for shortlived tasks
      - creates pods and ensures that a specified number of them terminate successfully
      - tracks completions
      - when a specified number of completions are reached, the job is complete
      - by default pod creation is sequential, but can be paralleled
    - CronJob
      - extension of Job
      - basically a Job that runs on cron schedule
      **search notes on Cron Schedules
      - last 3 successful and last 3 failed jobs are kept for history 
      - if you don't want any history you can set successfulJobHistoryLimit = 0
