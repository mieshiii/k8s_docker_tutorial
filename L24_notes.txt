Workloads
 - is an application that runs within K8s
 - Pod - the atomic Workload, represents a set of running containers
 - ReplicaSet
    - primary method of pod replicas and their lifecycle to provide self-healing capabilities
    - always ensures the desired number of pods are running
    - while can be used, recommended is to use Deployments
 - Deployment
    - Deployments self-heal, scale, update, or rollback
    - deployment manages a single pod template
    - typically you create one deployment per microservice
    - ReplicaSet provides self-healing and scalability, Deployments for the updates and rollbacks
    - Deployment components(?)
      - replicas: number of pod instances
      - revisionHistoryLimit: number of prev iterations to keep
      - strategy: rolling update or recreate
      - 
 - StatefulSet
 - DaemonSet - provide node-local facilities, such as a storage driver or network plugin
    - ensures all Nodes (or subsets run an instance of a Pod)
    - scheduled by scheduller controller and run by daemon controller
    - as nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them
    - typical uses: cluster storage, logs collection, node monitoring
    
 - Tasks that run to completion: 
    - Job
    - CronJob
