ConfigMaps
 - decouple and externalize configurations
 - referenced as environment variables
 - created from: Manifests, Files, Directories
 - static, if you change values, containers need to restart for it to reflect

Mount a Volume to a ConfigMap
 - solves the static issue
 - updates to values are reflected in containers
 - each key-value pair is seen as a file in the mounted directory

Secrets
 - same as ConfigMaps
 - stored as base64 encoded strings, as such not secure
 - protect them using RBAC authorization policies
 - store them elsewhere, e.g. in a secret store via cloud provideds etc.
