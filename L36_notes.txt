Scaling

Horizontal Scaling
 - uses k8s Metrics
 - Pods MUST have requests and limits defined
 - HPA checks the Metrics Server every 30s
 - sclae according to min and max number or replicas defined
 - Cooldown/delays between scaling up and down:
  - prevent racing conditions
  - once a change has been made, HPA waits
  - by default, scale up delay is 3m while scale down is 5m

**components.yaml is used to instantiate the metrics server for the lab
