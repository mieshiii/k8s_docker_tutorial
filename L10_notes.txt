Kubernetes - K8s
- a container orchestration platform
- manages the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of containerized applications
- provides a way to define and manage the desired state of a cluster

WHAT K8s CAN'T DO
- does not deploy source code
- does not build your applications
- does not provide application-level services (e.g., databases, message queues)

K8s CAN DO
- automate the deployment and scaling of containerized applications
- provide a way to define and manage the desired state of a cluster
- provide a way to distribute and manage state across multiple nodes in a cluster
- provide a way to orchestrate containerized applications across multiple nodes in a cluster

K8s COMPONENTS
- API Server: manages cluster resources and provides a RESTful API for managing the cluster
- Control Plane: manages the state of the cluster, including scheduling, managing pods, and managing containers
- Worker Nodes: the physical or virtual machines that run the containerized applications
- etcd: a distributed key-value store that stores the state of the cluster
- Kubernetes Master: the central control plane that configures and manages the cluster

Cluster -> Nodes -> Pods -> Containers -> Services/Applications
