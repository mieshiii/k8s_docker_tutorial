Nodes
 - Master Node (master) also known as Control Plane
 - multiple nodes form a cluster

kube-apiserver
 - REST interface
 - save state to the datastore (etcd)
 - all clients interact with it, never directly to the datastore

etcd
 - acts as the cluster datastore for storing state
 - KEY-VALUE store, not a database
 - only serves the cluster state, not for applications
 - singe source of truth

kube-control-manager
 - controller of controllers
 - runs other controllers such as:
  - node controller
  - replication controller
  - endpoint controller
  - service account and token controllers

cloud-controller-manager
 - interact with the cloud providers controllers

kube-scheduler
 - schedules pods on nodes
 - watches newly created pods and schedules them on nodes

addons
 - addons are optional components that can be installed on a cluster
 - such as: 
  - DNS
  - dashboard
  - cluster-level logging
  - container resource monitoring

Worker Nodes
 
kubelet
 - manage the pods lifecycle
 - ensures that the containers are running and healthy with respect to Pod specs

kube-proxy
 - network proxy that manages network rules on nodes

container runtime
 eg: - Moby
     - Containerd
     - Cri-0
     - Rkt
     - Kata
     - Virtlet

pre V1.19 acrhi: docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-configuration
post V1.19 uses crictl

Nodes pool
 - node pools is a group of VMs, all with the same sizes
 - clusters can have multiple node pools
  - pools can host different sizes of VMs
  - each pool can be autoscaled independently from other pools
**docker desktop is limited to 1 node
