pods
 - smallest unit of work in k8s
 - encapsulates an apllication's container
 - represents a unit of deployment
 - can run one or multiple containers
 - containers can share:
   - volumes
   - environment variables
   - secrets
   - config maps
   - ip addresses
 - containers can communicate via:
   - Localhost
   - IPC
 - pods are ephemeral
 - deployment of pods are atomic, successful or failed
 - if pods fails, it is replaced by a new pod (no updating happens) with an updated version
 - scaling is done by adding MORE PODS, NOT CONTAINERS in pods
 - pod states:
   - pending: accepted but not yet created
   - running: bound to a node
   - succeeded: exited with status 0
   - failed: all containers exit and at least one exited with non-zero status
   - unknown: communication issues with the pod
   - crashloopbackoff: started, crashed, and looped back to started and crashed

Init containers
 - initialize a Pod before an application container runs, prep for the app container
 - always run to completion
 - each init container is run in order, must complete before the next one can start
 - if it fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts it until in succeeds
    - unless it's restartPolicy is set to never
 - probes are not supported
