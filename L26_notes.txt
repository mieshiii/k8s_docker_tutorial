Services
- Pod IPs are unreliable, Services IPs are
- durable, static IP addresses, DNS name, [servicename].[namespace].svc.cluster.local
- Services are ways to access pods
- target Pods using Selectors

ClusterIP
- is the default service 
- it only visible internally
- Port refers to the port the service is listening to
- TargetPort is the port the service will redirect to the pod
- Load balancing is done via round robin, session affinity is configurable
- when to use: to provide a durable way to communicate with pods inside the cluster

NodePort
- extends the ClusterIP service
- visible internally and EXTERNALLY
- nodePort refers to the port the service is listening to externally, ranges bet. 30000-32767, statically defined
- k8s will assign a random port if not specified
- port is the port the service is listening to
- targetPort is the port the service will redirect to the pod
- Nodes must have public IP addresses
- User any NodeIP + nodePort to access the service

Load balancing
- L4 Load Balancing (Transport Layer)
  - operates at TCP
  - unable to make decisions based on content
  - simple algorithms such as round-robin routing
- L7 Load Balancing (Application Layer)
  - operates at HTTP/HTTPS/SMTP
  - able to make decisions based on the actual content
  - more complex algorithms such as weighted routing/routing rules
